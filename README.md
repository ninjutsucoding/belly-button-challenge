# belly-button-challenge, Module 14

Most of the code was made from the weekly activities.  I used XLA to double check the code but didn't come up with any big errors.   

I had a problem with the first bar chart.  Not sure what's wrong with the code.   
Each item is selectable but the top ten bar chart is not working propertly.  The bubble chart is working but looks different than the example.
